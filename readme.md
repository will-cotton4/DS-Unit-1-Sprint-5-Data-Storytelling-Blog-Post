## Deliverables

_The project has five parts. For each part, we've listed what's required to pass the Sprint Challenge, and what's recommended but not required._

### 1. Blog post

Required
- Choose your own topic and data.
- Write a blog post with at least two data visualizations, to communicate insights on your topic.
- Publish your post on Medium or your portfolio site.
- Don’t use data from Kaggle competitions or popular “toy” datasets.

Recommended
- Don't write a ["wall of text."](https://www.theonion.com/nation-shudders-at-large-block-of-uninterrupted-text-1819571366) Format your post to be [skimmable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/). Edit it to be [readable](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).
- Describe both your insights and your process, but focus more on the insights. Don’t include much code, if any, in your blog post.

### 2. Code
Required
- Create Python notebook(s) to wrangle, analyze, and visualize your data.
- Push your notebook(s) to your GitHub.

Recommended
- Keep it simple. Don’t use machine learning. (You’ll do this in future projects!)

### 3. Short summary
Required
- Describe your project in 280 characters or less.
- Choose one data visualization (static image or animated gif) from your blog post.
- [Annotate your visualization](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/) so it’s understandable on its own, without reading your blog post.

Recommended
- Share your short project summary on Twitter or LinkedIn, and link to your blog post.

### 4. Portfolio
Required
- Add your short summary to your portfolio site.
- Link from your portfolio site to your blog post and code.

Recommended
- Host your site with GitHub Pages.
- Include your name, bio, and contact info on your site.

### 5. Two minute presentation
Required
- Give a two minute presentation on Zoom for your cohort.

Recommended
